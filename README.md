## MemeBot
MemeBot was created with the sole purpose of generating memes in a more convenient way using Discord. MemeBot uses Imgflip.com API to generate images with user-specified parameters. MemeBot features a config with the ability to change remotely anything about the bot, it also supports multiple language (feel free to contribute translations!).

## Requirements
MemeBot uses the [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) package for [Luvit](https://luvit.io) to connect to the Discord API, therefore this will be required. Additionally, you will have to register an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and obtain a bot token.
